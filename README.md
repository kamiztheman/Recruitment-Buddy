# Recruitment-Buddy
This group of webpages will be a project dedicated to aggregating data from multiple sites all in one place, so that people recruiting for their World of Warcraft guilds can see logs,
raiderio score, overall character stats, pvp rating, and a generalized "report card" giving a letter grade for each individual category. This will be an ongoing and slow
project that I will keep uploaded here. This project is currently about 40% complete.
